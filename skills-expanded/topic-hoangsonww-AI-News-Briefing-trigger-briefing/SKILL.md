# Trigger Briefing Skill

Trigger a manual run of the daily AI News Briefing pipeline.
You can execute this by running `run_shell_command` with the command `make run` in the project root.
Monitor the output and let the user know when the run completes. Also, check the `logs/` directory for the latest log file and summarize its final output to confirm success or failure.
