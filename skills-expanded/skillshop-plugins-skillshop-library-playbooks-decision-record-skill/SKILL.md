# Decision Record

Capture context, drivers, options, decision, consequences and revisit triggers in a durable engineering decision record.

## Activate when

- architecture choice
- ADR
- tradeoff worth preserving

## Focus

- Primary mission: Capture context, drivers, options, decision, consequences and revisit triggers in a durable engineering decision record.
- Use project/runtime evidence; this skill is a workflow, not a role-play persona.
- If another skill owns a deeper specialist concern, hand off instead of duplicating its entire workflow.

## Workflow

1. Establish the authoritative goal, actors, constraints, non-goals, and current context.
2. Find ambiguities or decisions that materially change implementation; resolve from evidence when possible and surface the rest explicitly.
3. Break the problem into observable behaviors and engineering constraints rather than file-level tasks.
4. Compare credible options when there is a real design choice; do not manufacture fake alternatives.
5. Identify high-risk assumptions and the cheapest experiment or inspection that could invalidate them.
6. Define acceptance or decision criteria before recommending execution.
7. Produce a durable plan that another engineer can follow without reconstructing hidden reasoning.

## Deliverables

- Decision/plan artifact
- Acceptance or decision criteria
- Open risks and assumptions
- A result that directly satisfies: Capture context, drivers, options, decision, consequences and revisit triggers in a durable engineering decision record.

## Common failure modes

- Turning assumptions into requirements without marking them
- File-by-file task lists with no acceptance criteria
- Choosing architecture before identifying the risky unknowns
- Hiding uncertainty instead of stating what was not inspected, reproduced, measured, or verified.

## Composition

Use `skill-router` when this task needs multiple specialties. Prefer composition over copying another skill's workflow into this one.

## Exit criteria

- The requested decision, change, test, or review is supported by concrete evidence.
- Important residual risks, limitations, and unknowns are explicit.
- The output is specific enough for another engineer or agent to act on without reconstructing hidden reasoning.
