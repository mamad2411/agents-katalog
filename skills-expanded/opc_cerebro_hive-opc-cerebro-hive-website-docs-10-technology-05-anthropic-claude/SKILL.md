# Anthropic Claude -- Usage Guide

## Purpose

Claude Sonnet, Opus, and Haiku -- capability mapping, API integration, and enterprise patterns.

## Technical Overview

CerebroHive's technology stack standards reflect a philosophy of using best-in-class tools at each layer of the AI system architecture while avoiding vendor lock-in at the infrastructure and data platform layers. We are deliberately agnostic on cloud provider and data platform, enabling us to work within client environments regardless of their existing infrastructure commitments, while maintaining preferred vendor relationships with the leading AI tooling providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Weights & Biases, Pinecone, dbt Labs) where the competitive landscape makes a clear best-in-class choice.

CerebroHive's AI engineering standards cover five technical domains: Python coding standards (PEP 8 compliance, type hints, docstring requirements, and AI-specific code patterns for prompt construction and model API calls), infrastructure as code standards (Terraform for cloud infrastructure, Helm charts for Kubernetes deployments, and GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipelines), data engineering standards (dbt modeling conventions, data quality test requirements, and documentation standards), ML engineering standards (experiment tracking requirements, model card documentation, and deployment checklist), and security standards (secret management, API key rotation, data encryption at rest and in transit, and vulnerability scanning in CI/CD pipelines).

CerebroHive's open source strategy prioritizes proven, widely-adopted frameworks over novel but unproven tools. Our core technology choices -- LangChain/LangGraph for LLM orchestration, MLflow for experiment tracking, dbt for data transformation, FastAPI for AI service APIs, and Kubernetes for container orchestration -- are all mature, well-documented, and supported by large communities. This means our clients benefit from available talent, extensive documentation, and long-term viability rather than the risk of building on frameworks that may not be maintained.

CerebroHive's MLOps & AI Operations practice builds and runs the operational infrastructure that keeps AI systems reliable, improving, and compliant in production. We design MLOps pipelines (using MLflow, Kubeflow, or Vertex AI Pipelines), LLMOps systems (using LangSmith, Weights & Biases, or Arize), model monitoring platforms, retraining automation, and the incident response processes that enterprise AI programs require to operate safely at scale.

The distinction between a successful AI proof-of-concept and a successful AI production system is almost entirely an MLOps problem. Data drift, model decay, input distribution shift, upstream data pipeline failures, inference latency degradation, and silent accuracy regressions are the failure modes that destroy business value from AI systems in production. CerebroHive's CortexOps™ framework systematizes the detection and response to all six failure modes, establishing the operational discipline that enterprise AI requires.

CerebroHive's MLOps practice covers the full production AI lifecycle: CI/CD for ML (automated testing, model validation, canary deployment, and rollback), model monitoring (data drift detection, performance tracking, bias monitoring, and cost monitoring), model registry management (version control, lineage, and approval workflows), retraining automation (trigger-based and schedule-based retraining pipelines), and production incident response (on-call processes, runbooks, and post-mortem methodology).
