description: Update Svipall to the latest stable release in one step, through its existing installation channel, and refresh the skills copied by hand. Use when the user asks to check for, install, or manage Svipall updates.

# Update Svipall

Asking to update is the consent: do not ask again. If the user only asked whether a newer version
exists, run `svipall update --check`, report `current` and `latest`, and stop.

## 1. Update

```bash
svipall update
```

It replaces the `svipall` and `svipall-mcp` binaries shared by every harness, through the channel
that installed them, and refreshes each Svipall skill copied by hand (`skills_refreshed`).
`~/.svipall` (configuration, profiles, cookies, cache, models, managed browser) is never touched.

If `installed` is false and `update_available` is still true, `note` says why:

- Another channel (Homebrew, Scoop, Cargo, npm, container): run `install_command`, then
  `svipall update` once more.
- Windows: the running executable cannot replace itself. Ask the user to close every harness
  running `svipall-mcp`, run `install_command` in PowerShell, then `svipall update` once more.
- `channel` is `unknown`: stop and say where the executable lives; never put a second copy on
  `PATH`.

No binary at all → offer the setup flow; an update is not an installation. A binary older than
1.0.5 answers `svipall update` with an error: read `tag_name` from
`https://api.github.com/repos/ilien-dev/svipall/releases/latest` and run that tag's installer with
`--version <tag> --prefix <directory of the current svipall> --yes` (`-Version`, `-Prefix`, `-Yes`
in PowerShell). The older `svipall update --install` spelling still works.

## 2. Check the dashboard port

The restarted `svipall-mcp` must bind the same dashboard port. Read `dashboard.port` from
`svipall doctor` and see who is listening on it:

| Platform | Command |
|---|---|
| Linux | `ss -ltnpH "sport = :PORT"` |
| macOS | `lsof -nP -iTCP:PORT -sTCP:LISTEN` |
| Windows | `Get-Process -Id (Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort PORT -State Listen).OwningProcess` |

Nobody, or `svipall-mcp`: nothing to do. Another program: name it and its PID, and ask whether to
move Svipall to a free port. On yes, set `dashboard_port = <port>` in `~/.svipall/config.toml`,
keeping every other key. On no, say the captcha dashboard cannot start until that program frees
the port.

## 3. End with the restart

Finish with the `note` the update printed: the user must close every session that uses Svipall
(Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, OpenCode...) and open it again, which is how the harness restarts
with the new version. A Claude marketplace refreshes the plugin files on its own.
