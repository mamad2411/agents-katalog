# Context Optimization Techniques

Context optimization extends the effective capacity of limited context windows through strategic compression, masking, caching, and partitioning. The goal is not to magically increase context windows but to make better use of available capacity. Effective optimization can double or triple effective context capacity without requiring larger models or longer contexts.

## When to Activate

Activate this skill when:
- Context limits constrain task complexity
- Optimizing for cost reduction (fewer tokens = lower costs)
- Reducing latency for long conversations
- Implementing long-running agent systems
- Needing to handle larger documents or conversations
- Building production systems at scale

## Core Concepts

Context optimization extends effective capacity through four primary strategies: compaction (summarizing context near limits), observation masking (replacing verbose outputs with references), KV-cache optimization (reusing cached computations), and context partitioning (splitting work across isolated contexts).

The key insight is that context quality matters more than quantity. Optimization preserves signal while reducing noise. The art lies in selecting what to keep versus what to discard, and when to apply each technique.

## Detailed Topics

### Compaction Strategies

**What is Compaction**
Compaction is the practice of summarizing context contents when approaching limits, then reinitializing a new context window with the summary. This distills the contents of a context window in a high-fidelity manner, enabling the agent to continue with minimal performance degradation.

Compaction typically serves as the first lever in context optimization. The art lies in selecting what to keep versus what to discard.

**Compaction Implementation**
Compaction works by identifying sections that can be compressed, generating summaries that capture essential points, and replacing full content with summaries. Priority for compression goes to tool outputs (replace with summaries), old turns (summarize early conversation), retrieved docs (summarize if recent versions exist), and never compress system prompt.

**Summary Generation**
Effective summaries preserve different elements depending on message type:

Tool outputs: Preserve key findings, metrics, and conclusions. Remove verbose raw output.

Conversational turns: Preserve key decisions, commitments, and context shifts. Remove filler and back-and-forth.

Retrieved documents: Preserve key facts and claims. Remove supporting evidence and elaboration.

### Observation Masking

**The Observation Problem**
Tool outputs can comprise 80%+ of token usage in agent trajectories. Much of this is verbose output that has already served its purpose. Once an agent has used a tool output to make a decision, keeping the full output provides diminishing value while consuming significant context.

Observation masking replaces verbose tool outputs with compact references. The information remains accessible if needed but does not consume context continuously.

**Masking Strategy Selection**
Not all observations should be masked equally:

Never mask: Observations critical to current task, observations from the most recent turn, observations used in active reasoning.

Consider masking: Observations from 3+ turns ago, verbose outputs with key points extractable, observations whose purpose has been served.

Always mask: Repeated outputs, boilerplate headers/footers, outputs already summarized in conversation.

### KV-Cache Optimization

**Understanding KV-Cache**
The KV-cache stores Key and Value tensors computed during inference, growing linearly with sequence length. Caching the KV-cache across requests sharing identical prefixes avoids recomputation.

Prefix caching reuses KV blocks across requests with identical prefixes using hash-based block matching. This dramatically reduces cost and latency for requests with common prefixes like system prompts.

**Cache Optimization Patterns**
Optimize for caching by reordering context elements to maximize cache hits. Place stable elements first (system prompt, tool definitions), then frequently reused elements, then unique elements last.

Design prompts to maximize cache stability: avoid dynamic content like timestamps, use consistent formatting, keep structure stable across sessions.

### Context Partitioning

**Sub-Agent Partitioning**
The most aggressive form of context optimization is partitioning work across sub-agents with isolated contexts. Each sub-agent operates in a clean context focused on its subtask without carrying accumulated context from other subtasks.

This approach achieves separation of concerns—the detailed search context remains isolated within sub-agents while the coordinator focuses on synthesis and analysis.

**Result Aggregation**
Aggregate results from partitioned subtasks by validating all partitions completed, merging compatible results, and summarizing if still too large.

### Budget Management

**Context Budget Allocation**
Design explicit context budgets. Allocate tokens to categories: system prompt, tool definitions, retrieved docs, message history, and reserved buffer. Monitor usage against budget and trigger optimization when approaching limits.

**Trigger-Based Optimization**
Monitor signals for optimization triggers: token utilization above 80%, degradation indicators, and performance drops. Apply appropriate optimization techniques based on context composition.

## Practical Guidance

### Optimization Decision Framework

When to optimize:
- Context utilization exceeds 70%
- Response quality degrades as conversations extend
- Costs increase due to long contexts
- Latency increases with conversation length

What to apply:
- Tool outputs dominate: observation masking
- Retrieved documents dominate: summarization or partitioning
- Message history dominates: compaction with summarization
- Multiple components: combine strategies

### Performance Considerations

Compaction should achieve 50-70% token reduction with less than 5% quality degradation. Masking should achieve 60-80% reduction in masked observations. Cache optimization should achieve 70%+ hit rate for stable workloads.

Monitor and iterate on optimization strategies based on measured effectiveness.

## Examples

**Example 1: Compaction Trigger**
```python
if context_tokens / context_limit > 0.8:
    context = compact_context(context)
```

**Example 2: Observation Masking**
```python
if len(observation) > max_length:
    ref_id = store_observation(observation)
    return f"[Obs:{ref_id} elided. Key: {extract_key(observation)}]"
```

**Example 3: Cache-Friendly Ordering**
```python
# Stable content first
context = [system_prompt, tool_definitions]  # Cacheable
context += [reused_templates]  # Reusable
context += [unique_content]  # Unique
```

## Guidelines

1. Measure before optimizing—know your current state
2. Apply compaction before masking when possible
3. Design for cache stability with consistent prompts
4. Partition before context becomes problematic
5. Monitor optimization effectiveness over time
6. Balance token savings against quality preservation
7. Test optimization at production scale
8. Implement graceful degradation for edge cases

# Context Degradation Patterns

Language models exhibit predictable degradation patterns as context length increases. Understanding these patterns is essential for diagnosing failures and designing resilient systems. Context degradation is not a binary state but a continuum of performance degradation that manifests in several distinct ways.

## When to Activate

Activate this skill when:
- Agent performance degrades unexpectedly during long conversations
- Debugging cases where agents produce incorrect or irrelevant outputs
- Designing systems that must handle large contexts reliably
- Evaluating context engineering choices for production systems
- Investigating "lost in middle" phenomena in agent outputs
- Analyzing context-related failures in agent behavior

## Core Concepts

Context degradation manifests through several distinct patterns. The lost-in-middle phenomenon causes information in the center of context to receive less attention. Context poisoning occurs when errors compound through repeated reference. Context distraction happens when irrelevant information overwhelms relevant content. Context confusion arises when the model cannot determine which context applies. Context clash develops when accumulated information directly conflicts.

These patterns are predictable and can be mitigated through architectural patterns like compaction, masking, partitioning, and isolation.

## Detailed Topics

### The Lost-in-Middle Phenomenon

The most well-documented degradation pattern is the "lost-in-middle" effect, where models demonstrate U-shaped attention curves. Information at the beginning and end of context receives reliable attention, while information buried in the middle suffers from dramatically reduced recall accuracy.

**Empirical Evidence**
Research demonstrates that relevant information placed in the middle of context experiences 10-40% lower recall accuracy compared to the same information at the beginning or end. This is not a failure of the model but a consequence of attention mechanics and training data distributions.

Models allocate massive attention to the first token (often the BOS token) to stabilize internal states. This creates an "attention sink" that soaks up attention budget. As context grows, the limited budget is stretched thinner, and middle tokens fail to garner sufficient attention weight for reliable retrieval.

**Practical Implications**
Design context placement with attention patterns in mind. Place critical information at the beginning or end of context. Consider whether information will be queried directly or needs to support reasoning—if the latter, placement matters less but overall signal quality matters more.

For long documents or conversations, use summary structures that surface key information at attention-favored positions. Use explicit section headers and transitions to help models navigate structure.

### Context Poisoning

Context poisoning occurs when hallucinations, errors, or incorrect information enters context and compounds through repeated reference. Once poisoned, context creates feedback loops that reinforce incorrect beliefs.

**How Poisoning Occurs**
Poisoning typically enters through three pathways. First, tool outputs may contain errors or unexpected formats that models accept as ground truth. Second, retrieved documents may contain incorrect or outdated information that models incorporate into reasoning. Third, model-generated summaries or intermediate outputs may introduce hallucinations that persist in context.

The compounding effect is severe. If an agent's goals section becomes poisoned, it develops strategies that take substantial effort to undo. Each subsequent decision references the poisoned content, reinforcing incorrect assumptions.

**Detection and Recovery**
Watch for symptoms including degraded output quality on tasks that previously succeeded, tool misalignment where agents call wrong tools or parameters, and hallucinations that persist despite correction attempts. When these symptoms appear, consider context poisoning.

Recovery requires removing or replacing poisoned content. This may involve truncating context to before the poisoning point, explicitly noting the poisoning in context and asking for re-evaluation, or restarting with clean context and preserving only verified information.

### Context Distraction

Context distraction emerges when context grows so long that models over-focus on provided information at the expense of their training knowledge. The model attends to everything in context regardless of relevance, and this creates pressure to use provided information even when internal knowledge is more accurate.

**The Distractor Effect**
Research shows that even a single irrelevant document in context reduces performance on tasks involving relevant documents. Multiple distractors compound degradation. The effect is not about noise in absolute terms but about attention allocation—irrelevant information competes with relevant information for limited attention budget.

Models do not have a mechanism to "skip" irrelevant context. They must attend to everything provided, and this obligation creates distraction even when the irrelevant information is clearly not useful.

**Mitigation Strategies**
Mitigate distraction through careful curation of what enters context. Apply relevance filtering before loading retrieved documents. Use namespacing and organization to make irrelevant sections easy to ignore structurally. Consider whether information truly needs to be in context or can be accessed through tool calls instead.

### Context Confusion

Context confusion arises when irrelevant information influences responses in ways that degrade quality. This is related to distraction but distinct—confusion concerns the influence of context on model behavior rather than attention allocation.

If you put something in context, the model has to pay attention to it. The model may incorporate irrelevant information, use inappropriate tool definitions, or apply constraints that came from different contexts. Confusion is especially problematic when context contains multiple task types or when switching between tasks within a single session.

**Signs of Confusion**
Watch for responses that address the wrong aspect of a query, tool calls that seem appropriate for a different task, or outputs that mix requirements from multiple sources. These indicate confusion about what context applies to the current situation.

**Architectural Solutions**
Architectural solutions include explicit task segmentation where different tasks get different context windows, clear transitions between task contexts, and state management that isolates context for different objectives.

### Context Clash

Context clash develops when accumulated information directly conflicts, creating contradictory guidance that derails reasoning. This differs from poisoning where one piece of information is incorrect—in clash, multiple correct pieces of information contradict each other.

**Sources of Clash**
Clash commonly arises from multi-source retrieval where different sources have contradictory information, version conflicts where outdated and current information both appear in context, and perspective conflicts where different viewpoints are valid but incompatible.

**Resolution Approaches**
Resolution approaches include explicit conflict marking that identifies contradictions and requests clarification, priority rules that establish which source takes precedence, and version filtering that excludes outdated information from context.

### Empirical Benchmarks and Thresholds

Research provides concrete data on degradation patterns that inform design decisions.

**RULER Benchmark Findings**
The RULER benchmark delivers sobering findings: only 50% of models claiming 32K+ context maintain satisfactory performance at 32K tokens. GPT-5.2 shows the least degradation among current models, while many still drop 30+ points at extended contexts. Near-perfect scores on simple needle-in-haystack tests do not translate to real long-context understanding.

**Model-Specific Degradation Thresholds**
| Model | Degradation Onset | Severe Degradation | Notes |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|-------|
| GPT-5.2 | ~64K tokens | ~200K tokens | Best overall degradation resistance with thinking mode |
| Claude Opus 4.5 | ~100K tokens | ~180K tokens | 200K context window, strong attention management |
| Claude Sonnet 4.5 | ~80K tokens | ~150K tokens | Optimized for agents and coding tasks |
| Gemini 3 Pro | ~500K tokens | ~800K tokens | 1M context window, native multimodality |
| Gemini 3 Flash | ~300K tokens | ~600K tokens | 3x speed of Gemini 2.5, 81.2% MMMU-Pro |

**Model-Specific Behavior Patterns**
Different models exhibit distinct failure modes under context pressure:

- **Claude 4.5 series**: Lowest hallucination rates with calibrated uncertainty. Claude Opus 4.5 achieves 80.9% on SWE-bench Verified. Tends to refuse or ask clarification rather than fabricate.
- **GPT-5.2**: Two modes available - instant (fast) and thinking (reasoning). Thinking mode reduces hallucination through step-by-step verification but increases latency.
- **Gemini 3 Pro/Flash**: Native multimodality with 1M context window. Gemini 3 Flash offers 3x speed improvement over previous generation. Strong at multi-modal reasoning across text, code, images, audio, and video.

These patterns inform model selection for different use cases. High-stakes tasks benefit from Claude 4.5's conservative approach or GPT-5.2's thinking mode; speed-critical tasks may use instant modes.

### Counterintuitive Findings

Research reveals several counterintuitive patterns that challenge assumptions about context management.

**Shuffled Haystacks Outperform Coherent Ones**
Studies found that shuffled (incoherent) haystacks produce better performance than logically coherent ones. This suggests that coherent context may create false associations that confuse retrieval, while incoherent context forces models to rely on exact matching.

**Single Distractors Have Outsized Impact**
Even a single irrelevant document reduces performance significantly. The effect is not proportional to the amount of noise but follows a step function where the presence of any distractor triggers degradation.

**Needle-Question Similarity Correlation**
Lower similarity between needle and question pairs shows faster degradation with context length. Tasks requiring inference across dissimilar content are particularly vulnerable.

### When Larger Contexts Hurt

Larger context windows do not uniformly improve performance. In many cases, larger contexts create new problems that outweigh benefits.

**Performance Degradation Curves**
Models exhibit non-linear degradation with context length. Performance remains stable up to a threshold, then degrades rapidly. The threshold varies by model and task complexity. For many models, meaningful degradation begins around 8,000-16,000 tokens even when context windows support much larger sizes.

**Cost Implications**
Processing cost grows disproportionately with context length. The cost to process a 400K token context is not double the cost of 200K—it increases exponentially in both time and computing resources. For many applications, this makes large-context processing economically impractical.

**Cognitive Load Metaphor**
Even with an infinite context, asking a single model to maintain consistent quality across dozens of independent tasks creates a cognitive bottleneck. The model must constantly switch context between items, maintain a comparative framework, and ensure stylistic consistency. This is not a problem that more context solves.

## Practical Guidance

### The Four-Bucket Approach

Four strategies address different aspects of context degradation:

**Write**: Save context outside the window using scratchpads, file systems, or external storage. This keeps active context lean while preserving information access.

**Select**: Pull relevant context into the window through retrieval, filtering, and prioritization. This addresses distraction by excluding irrelevant information.

**Compress**: Reduce tokens while preserving information through summarization, abstraction, and observation masking. This extends effective context capacity.

**Isolate**: Split context across sub-agents or sessions to prevent any single context from growing large enough to degrade. This is the most aggressive strategy but often the most effective.

### Architectural Patterns

Implement these strategies through specific architectural patterns. Use just-in-time context loading to retrieve information only when needed. Use observation masking to replace verbose tool outputs with compact references. Use sub-agent architectures to isolate context for different tasks. Use compaction to summarize growing context before it exceeds limits.

## Examples

**Example 1: Detecting Degradation**
```yaml
# Context grows during long conversation
turn_1: 1000 tokens
turn_5: 8000 tokens
turn_10: 25000 tokens
turn_20: 60000 tokens (degradation begins)
turn_30: 90000 tokens (significant degradation)
```

**Example 2: Mitigating Lost-in-Middle**
```markdown
# Organize context with critical info at edges

[CURRENT TASK]                      # At start
- Goal: Generate quarterly report
- Deadline: End of week

[DETAILED CONTEXT]                  # Middle (less attention)
- 50 pages of data
- Multiple analysis sections
- Supporting evidence

[KEY FINDINGS]                     # At end
- Revenue up 15%
- Costs down 8%
- Growth in Region A
```

## Guidelines

1. Monitor context length and performance correlation during development
2. Place critical information at beginning or end of context
3. Implement compaction triggers before degradation becomes severe
4. Validate retrieved documents for accuracy before adding to context
5. Use versioning to prevent outdated information from causing clash
6. Segment tasks to prevent context confusion across different objectives
7. Design for graceful degradation rather than assuming perfect conditions
8. Test with progressively larger contexts to find degradation thresholds

# Context Compression Strategies

When agent sessions generate millions of tokens of conversation history, compression becomes mandatory. The naive approach is aggressive compression to minimize tokens per request. The correct optimization target is tokens per task: total tokens consumed to complete a task, including re-fetching costs when compression loses critical information.

## When to Activate

Activate this skill when:
- Agent sessions exceed context window limits
- Codebases exceed context windows (5M+ token systems)
- Designing conversation summarization strategies
- Debugging cases where agents "forget" what files they modified
- Building evaluation frameworks for compression quality

## Core Concepts

Context compression trades token savings against information loss. Three production-ready approaches exist:

1. **Anchored Iterative Summarization**: Maintain structured, persistent summaries with explicit sections for session intent, file modifications, decisions, and next steps. When compression triggers, summarize only the newly-truncated span and merge with the existing summary. Structure forces preservation by dedicating sections to specific information types.

2. **Opaque Compression**: Produce compressed representations optimized for reconstruction fidelity. Achieves highest compression ratios (99%+) but sacrifices interpretability. Cannot verify what was preserved.

3. **Regenerative Full Summary**: Generate detailed structured summaries on each compression. Produces readable output but may lose details across repeated compression cycles due to full regeneration rather than incremental merging.

The critical insight: structure forces preservation. Dedicated sections act as checklists that the summarizer must populate, preventing silent information drift.

## Detailed Topics

### Why Tokens-Per-Task Matters

Traditional compression metrics target tokens-per-request. This is the wrong optimization. When compression loses critical details like file paths or error messages, the agent must re-fetch information, re-explore approaches, and waste tokens recovering context.

The right metric is tokens-per-task: total tokens consumed from task start to completion. A compression strategy saving 0.5% more tokens but causing 20% more re-fetching costs more overall.

### The Artifact Trail Problem

Artifact trail integrity is the weakest dimension across all compression methods, scoring 2.2-2.5 out of 5.0 in evaluations. Even structured summarization with explicit file sections struggles to maintain complete file tracking across long sessions.

Coding agents need to know:
- Which files were created
- Which files were modified and what changed
- Which files were read but not changed
- Function names, variable names, error messages

This problem likely requires specialized handling beyond general summarization: a separate artifact index or explicit file-state tracking in agent scaffolding.

### Structured Summary Sections

Effective structured summaries include explicit sections:

```markdown
## Session Intent
[What the user is trying to accomplish]

## Files Modified
- auth.controller.ts: Fixed JWT token generation
- config/redis.ts: Updated connection pooling
- tests/auth.test.ts: Added mock setup for new config

## Decisions Made
- Using Redis connection pool instead of per-request connections
- Retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures

## Current State
- 14 tests passing, 2 failing
- Remaining: mock setup for session service tests

## Next Steps
1. Fix remaining test failures
2. Run full test suite
3. Update documentation
```

This structure prevents silent loss of file paths or decisions because each section must be explicitly addressed.

### Compression Trigger Strategies

When to trigger compression matters as much as how to compress:

| Strategy | Trigger Point | Trade-off |
|----------|---------------|-----------|
| Fixed threshold | 70-80% context utilization | Simple but may compress too early |
| Sliding window | Keep last N turns + summary | Predictable context size |
| Importance-based | Compress low-relevance sections first | Complex but preserves signal |
| Task-boundary | Compress at logical task completions | Clean summaries but unpredictable timing |

The sliding window approach with structured summaries provides the best balance of predictability and quality for most coding agent use cases.

### Probe-Based Evaluation

Traditional metrics like ROUGE or embedding similarity fail to capture functional compression quality. A summary may score high on lexical overlap while missing the one file path the agent needs.

Probe-based evaluation directly measures functional quality by asking questions after compression:

| Probe Type | What It Tests | Example Question |
|------------|---------------|------------------|
| Recall | Factual retention | "What was the original error message?" |
| Artifact | File tracking | "Which files have we modified?" |
| Continuation | Task planning | "What should we do next?" |
| Decision | Reasoning chain | "What did we decide about the Redis issue?" |

If compression preserved the right information, the agent answers correctly. If not, it guesses or hallucinates.

### Evaluation Dimensions

Six dimensions capture compression quality for coding agents:

1. **Accuracy**: Are technical details correct? File paths, function names, error codes.
2. **Context Awareness**: Does the response reflect current conversation state?
3. **Artifact Trail**: Does the agent know which files were read or modified?
4. **Completeness**: Does the response address all parts of the question?
5. **Continuity**: Can work continue without re-fetching information?
6. **Instruction Following**: Does the response respect stated constraints?

Accuracy shows the largest variation between compression methods (0.6 point gap). Artifact trail is universally weak (2.2-2.5 range).

## Practical Guidance

### Three-Phase Compression Workflow

For large codebases or agent systems exceeding context windows, apply compression through three phases:

1. **Research Phase**: Produce a research document from architecture diagrams, documentation, and key interfaces. Compress exploration into a structured analysis of components and dependencies. Output: single research document.

2. **Planning Phase**: Convert research into implementation specification with function signatures, type definitions, and data flow. A 5M token codebase compresses to approximately 2,000 words of specification.

3. **Implementation Phase**: Execute against the specification. Context remains focused on the spec rather than raw codebase exploration.

### Using Example Artifacts as Seeds

When provided with a manual migration example or reference PR, use it as a template to understand the target pattern. The example reveals constraints that static analysis cannot surface: which invariants must hold, which services break on changes, and what a clean migration looks like.

This is particularly important when the agent cannot distinguish essential complexity (business requirements) from accidental complexity (legacy workarounds). The example artifact encodes that distinction.

### Implementing Anchored Iterative Summarization

1. Define explicit summary sections matching your agent's needs
2. On first compression trigger, summarize truncated history into sections
3. On subsequent compressions, summarize only new truncated content
4. Merge new summary into existing sections rather than regenerating
5. Track which information came from which compression cycle for debugging

### When to Use Each Approach

**Use anchored iterative summarization when:**
- Sessions are long-running (100+ messages)
- File tracking matters (coding, debugging)
- You need to verify what was preserved

**Use opaque compression when:**
- Maximum token savings required
- Sessions are relatively short
- Re-fetching costs are low

**Use regenerative summaries when:**
- Summary interpretability is critical
- Sessions have clear phase boundaries
- Full context review is acceptable on each compression

### Compression Ratio Considerations

| Method | Compression Ratio | Quality Score | Trade-off |
|--------|-------------------|---------------|-----------|
| Anchored Iterative | 98.6% | 3.70 | Best quality, slightly less compression |
| Regenerative | 98.7% | 3.44 | Good quality, moderate compression |
| Opaque | 99.3% | 3.35 | Best compression, quality loss |

The 0.7% additional tokens retained by structured summarization buys 0.35 quality points. For any task where re-fetching costs matter, this trade-off favors structured approaches.

## Examples

**Example 1: Debugging Session Compression**

Original context (89,000 tokens, 178 messages):
- 401 error on /api/auth/login endpoint
- Traced through auth controller, middleware, session store
- Found stale Redis connection
- Fixed connection pooling, added retry logic
- 14 tests passing, 2 failing

Structured summary after compression:

```markdown
## Session Intent
Debug 401 Unauthorized error on /api/auth/login despite valid credentials.

## Root Cause
Stale Redis connection in session store. JWT generated correctly but session could not be persisted.

## Files Modified
- auth.controller.ts: No changes (read only)
- middleware/cors.ts: No changes (examined)
- config/redis.ts: Fixed connection pooling configuration
- services/session.service.ts: Added retry logic for transient failures
- tests/auth.test.ts: Updated mock setup

## Test Status
14 passing, 2 failing (mock setup issues)

## Next Steps
1. Fix remaining test failures (mock session service)
2. Run full test suite
3. Deploy to staging
```

**Example 2: Probe Response Quality**

After compression, asking "What was the original error?":

Good response (structured summarization):
> "The original error was a 401 Unauthorized response from the /api/auth/login endpoint. Users received this error with valid credentials. Root cause was stale Redis connection in session store."

Poor response (aggressive compression):
> "We were debugging an authentication issue. The login was failing. We fixed some configuration problems."

The structured response preserves endpoint, error code, and root cause. The aggressive response loses all technical detail.

## Guidelines

1. Optimize for tokens-per-task, not tokens-per-request
2. Use structured summaries with explicit sections for file tracking
3. Trigger compression at 70-80% context utilization
4. Implement incremental merging rather than full regeneration
5. Test compression quality with probe-based evaluation
6. Track artifact trail separately if file tracking is critical
7. Accept slightly lower compression ratios for better quality retention
8. Monitor re-fetching frequency as a compression quality signal

# Context-Driven Development

Guide for implementing and maintaining context as a managed artifact alongside code, enabling consistent AI interactions and team alignment through structured project documentation.

## Core Philosophy

Context-Driven Development treats project context as a first-class artifact managed alongside code. Instead of relying on ad-hoc prompts or scattered documentation, establish a persistent, structured foundation that informs all AI interactions.

Key principles:

1. **Context precedes code**: Define what you're building and how before implementation
2. **Living documentation**: Context artifacts evolve with the project
3. **Single source of truth**: One canonical location for each type of information
4. **AI alignment**: Consistent context produces consistent AI behavior

## The Workflow

Follow the **Context → Spec & Plan → Implement** workflow:

1. **Context Phase**: Establish or verify project context artifacts exist and are current
2. **Specification Phase**: Define requirements and acceptance criteria for work units
3. **Planning Phase**: Break specifications into phased, actionable tasks
4. **Implementation Phase**: Execute tasks following established workflow patterns

## Artifact Relationships

2. Document the rationale for new dependencies
3. Add version constraints
4. Note any configuration requirements

### Update product.md When Features Complete

After completing a feature track:

1. Move feature from "planned" to "implemented" in product.md
2. Update any affected success metrics
3. Document any scope changes from original plan

### Verify Context Before Implementation

Before starting any track:

1. Read all context artifacts
2. Flag any outdated information
3. Propose updates before proceeding
4. Confirm context accuracy with stakeholders

## Greenfield vs Brownfield Handling

## Context Lifecycle

1. **Creation**: Initial setup via `/conductor:setup`
2. **Validation**: Verify before each track
3. **Evolution**: Update as project grows
4. **Synchronization**: Keep artifacts aligned
5. **Archival**: Document historical decisions

## Context Validation Checklist

Before starting implementation on any track, validate context:

### Product Context

- [ ] product.md reflects current product vision
- [ ] Target users are accurately described
- [ ] Feature list is up to date
- [ ] Success metrics are defined

### Technical Context

- [ ] tech-stack.md lists all current dependencies
- [ ] Version numbers are accurate
- [ ] Infrastructure targets are correct
- [ ] Development tools are documented

### Workflow Context

- [ ] workflow.md describes current practices
- [ ] Quality gates are defined
- [ ] Coverage targets are specified
- [ ] Commit conventions are documented

### Track Context

- [ ] tracks.md shows all active work
- [ ] No stale or abandoned tracks
- [ ] Dependencies between tracks are noted

## Common Anti-Patterns

Avoid these context management mistakes:

### Stale Context

Problem: Context documents become outdated and misleading.
Solution: Update context as part of each track's completion process.

### Context Sprawl

Problem: Information scattered across multiple locations.
Solution: Use the defined artifact structure; resist creating new document types.

### Implicit Context

Problem: Relying on knowledge not captured in artifacts.
Solution: If you reference something repeatedly, add it to the appropriate artifact.

### Context Hoarding

Problem: One person maintains context without team input.
Solution: Review context artifacts in pull requests; make updates collaborative.

### Over-Specification

Problem: Context becomes so detailed it's impossible to maintain.
Solution: Keep artifacts focused on decisions that affect AI behavior and team alignment.

## Integration with Development Tools

### IDE Integration

Configure your IDE to display context files prominently:

- Pin conductor/product.md for quick reference
- Add tech-stack.md to project notes
- Create snippets for common patterns from style guides

### Git Hooks

Consider pre-commit hooks that:

- Warn when dependencies change without tech-stack.md update
- Remind to update product.md when feature branches merge
- Validate context artifact syntax

### CI/CD Integration

Include context validation in pipelines:

- Check tech-stack.md matches actual dependencies
- Verify links in context documents resolve
- Ensure tracks.md status matches git branch state

## Session Continuity

Conductor supports multi-session development through context persistence:

### Starting a New Session

1. Read index.md to orient yourself
2. Check tracks.md for active work
3. Review relevant track's plan.md for current task
4. Verify context artifacts are current

### Ending a Session

1. Update plan.md with current progress
2. Note any blockers or decisions made
3. Commit in-progress work with clear status
4. Update tracks.md if status changed

### Handling Interruptions

If interrupted mid-task:

1. Mark task as `[~]` with note about stopping point
2. Commit work-in-progress to feature branch
3. Document any uncommitted decisions in plan.md

## Best Practices

1. **Read context first**: Always read relevant artifacts before starting work
2. **Small updates**: Make incremental context changes, not massive rewrites
3. **Link decisions**: Reference context when making implementation choices
4. **Version context**: Commit context changes alongside code changes
5. **Review context**: Include context artifact reviews in code reviews
6. **Validate regularly**: Run context validation checklist before major work
7. **Communicate changes**: Notify team when context artifacts change significantly
8. **Preserve history**: Use git to track context evolution over time
9. **Question staleness**: If context feels wrong, investigate and update
10. **Keep it actionable**: Every context item should inform a decision or behavior

# Context Engineering Fundamentals

Context is the complete state available to a language model at inference time. It includes everything the model can attend to when generating responses: system instructions, tool definitions, retrieved documents, message history, and tool outputs. Understanding context fundamentals is prerequisite to effective context engineering.

## When to Activate

Activate this skill when:
- Designing new agent systems or modifying existing architectures
- Debugging unexpected agent behavior that may relate to context
- Optimizing context usage to reduce token costs or improve performance
- Onboarding new team members to context engineering concepts
- Reviewing context-related design decisions

## Core Concepts

Context comprises several distinct components, each with different characteristics and constraints. The attention mechanism creates a finite budget that constrains effective context usage. Progressive disclosure manages this constraint by loading information only as needed. The engineering discipline is curating the smallest high-signal token set that achieves desired outcomes.

## Detailed Topics

### The Anatomy of Context

**System Prompts**
System prompts establish the agent's core identity, constraints, and behavioral guidelines. They are loaded once at session start and typically persist throughout the conversation. System prompts should be extremely clear and use simple, direct language at the right altitude for the agent.

The right altitude balances two failure modes. At one extreme, engineers hardcode complex brittle logic that creates fragility and maintenance burden. At the other extreme, engineers provide vague high-level guidance that fails to give concrete signals for desired outputs or falsely assumes shared context. The optimal altitude strikes a balance: specific enough to guide behavior effectively, yet flexible enough to provide strong heuristics.

Organize prompts into distinct sections using XML tagging or Markdown headers to delineate background information, instructions, tool guidance, and output description. The exact formatting matters less as models become more capable, but structural clarity remains valuable.

**Tool Definitions**
Tool definitions specify the actions an agent can take. Each tool includes a name, description, parameters, and return format. Tool definitions live near the front of context after serialization, typically before or after the system prompt.

Tool descriptions collectively steer agent behavior. Poor descriptions force agents to guess; optimized descriptions include usage context, examples, and defaults. The consolidation principle states that if a human engineer cannot definitively say which tool should be used in a given situation, an agent cannot be expected to do better.

**Retrieved Documents**
Retrieved documents provide domain-specific knowledge, reference materials, or task-relevant information. Agents use retrieval augmented generation to pull relevant documents into context at runtime rather than pre-loading all possible information.

The just-in-time approach maintains lightweight identifiers (file paths, stored queries, web links) and uses these references to load data into context dynamically. This mirrors human cognition: we generally do not memorize entire corpuses of information but rather use external organization and indexing systems to retrieve relevant information on demand.

**Message History**
Message history contains the conversation between the user and agent, including previous queries, responses, and reasoning. For long-running tasks, message history can grow to dominate context usage.

Message history serves as scratchpad memory where agents track progress, maintain task state, and preserve reasoning across turns. Effective management of message history is critical for long-horizon task completion.

**Tool Outputs**
Tool outputs are the results of agent actions: file contents, search results, command execution output, API responses, and similar data. Tool outputs comprise the majority of tokens in typical agent trajectories, with research showing observations (tool outputs) can reach 83.9% of total context usage.

Tool outputs consume context whether they are relevant to current decisions or not. This creates pressure for strategies like observation masking, compaction, and selective tool result retention.

### Context Windows and Attention Mechanics

**The Attention Budget Constraint**
Language models process tokens through attention mechanisms that create pairwise relationships between all tokens in context. For n tokens, this creates n² relationships that must be computed and stored. As context length increases, the model's ability to capture these relationships gets stretched thin.

Models develop attention patterns from training data distributions where shorter sequences predominate. This means models have less experience with and fewer specialized parameters for context-wide dependencies. The result is an "attention budget" that depletes as context grows.

**Position Encoding and Context Extension**
Position encoding interpolation allows models to handle longer sequences by adapting them to originally trained smaller contexts. However, this adaptation introduces degradation in token position understanding. Models remain highly capable at longer contexts but show reduced precision for information retrieval and long-range reasoning compared to performance on shorter contexts.

**The Progressive Disclosure Principle**
Progressive disclosure manages context efficiently by loading information only as needed. At startup, agents load only skill names and descriptions—sufficient to know when a skill might be relevant. Full content loads only when a skill is activated for specific tasks.

This approach keeps agents fast while giving them access to more context on demand. The principle applies at multiple levels: skill selection, document loading, and even tool result retrieval.

### Context Quality Versus Context Quantity

The assumption that larger context windows solve memory problems has been empirically debunked. Context engineering means finding the smallest possible set of high-signal tokens that maximize the likelihood of desired outcomes.

Several factors create pressure for context efficiency. Processing cost grows disproportionately with context length—not just double the cost for double the tokens, but exponentially more in time and computing resources. Model performance degrades beyond certain context lengths even when the window technically supports more tokens. Long inputs remain expensive even with prefix caching.

The guiding principle is informativity over exhaustiveness. Include what matters for the decision at hand, exclude what does not, and design systems that can access additional information on demand.

### Context as Finite Resource

Context must be treated as a finite resource with diminishing marginal returns. Like humans with limited working memory, language models have an attention budget drawn on when parsing large volumes of context.

Every new token introduced depletes this budget by some amount. This creates the need for careful curation of available tokens. The engineering problem is optimizing utility against inherent constraints.

Context engineering is iterative and the curation phase happens each time you decide what to pass to the model. It is not a one-time prompt writing exercise but an ongoing discipline of context management.

## Practical Guidance

### File-System-Based Access

Agents with filesystem access can use progressive disclosure naturally. Store reference materials, documentation, and data externally. Load files only when needed using standard filesystem operations. This pattern avoids stuffing context with information that may not be relevant.

The file system itself provides structure that agents can navigate. File sizes suggest complexity; naming conventions hint at purpose; timestamps serve as proxies for relevance. Metadata of file references provides a mechanism to efficiently refine behavior.

### Hybrid Strategies

The most effective agents employ hybrid strategies. Pre-load some context for speed (like CLAUDE.md files or project rules), but enable autonomous exploration for additional context as needed. The decision boundary depends on task characteristics and context dynamics.

For contexts with less dynamic content, pre-loading more upfront makes sense. For rapidly changing or highly specific information, just-in-time loading avoids stale context.

### Context Budgeting

Design with explicit context budgets in mind. Know the effective context limit for your model and task. Monitor context usage during development. Implement compaction triggers at appropriate thresholds. Design systems assuming context will degrade rather than hoping it will not.

Effective context budgeting requires understanding not just raw token counts but also attention distribution patterns. The middle of context receives less attention than the beginning and end. Place critical information at attention-favored positions.

## Examples

**Example 1: Organizing System Prompts**
```markdown
<BACKGROUND_INFORMATION>
You are a Python expert helping a development team.
Current project: Data processing pipeline in Python 3.9+
</BACKGROUND_INFORMATION>

<INSTRUCTIONS>
- Write clean, idiomatic Python code
- Include type hints for function signatures
- Add docstrings for public functions
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
</INSTRUCTIONS>

<TOOL_GUIDANCE>
Use bash for shell operations, python for code tasks.
File operations should use pathlib for cross-platform compatibility.
</TOOL_GUIDANCE>

<OUTPUT_DESCRIPTION>
Provide code blocks with syntax highlighting.
Explain non-obvious decisions in comments.
</OUTPUT_DESCRIPTION>
```

**Example 2: Progressive Document Loading**
```markdown
# Instead of loading all documentation at once:

# Step 1: Load summary
docs/api_summary.md          # Lightweight overview

# Step 2: Load specific section as needed
docs/api/endpoints.md        # Only when API calls needed
docs/api/authentication.md   # Only when auth context needed
```

## Guidelines

1. Treat context as a finite resource with diminishing returns
2. Place critical information at attention-favored positions (beginning and end)
3. Use progressive disclosure to defer loading until needed
4. Organize system prompts with clear section boundaries
5. Monitor context usage during development
6. Implement compaction triggers at 70-80% utilization
7. Design for context degradation rather than hoping to avoid it
8. Prefer smaller high-signal context over larger low-signal context
