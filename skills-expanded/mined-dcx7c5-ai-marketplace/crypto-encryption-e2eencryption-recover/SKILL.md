| X3DH | Initial key agreement | X25519 |
| Double Ratchet | Ongoing key management | X25519 + HKDF + AES-GCM |
| Sending Chain | Per-message encryption keys | HMAC-SHA256 chain |
| Receiving Chain | Per-message decryption keys | HMAC-SHA256 chain |
| Root Chain | Derives new chain keys on DH ratchet | HKDF |

### Forward Secrecy

Each message uses a unique encryption key derived from a ratcheting chain. After a key is used, it is deleted, ensuring that compromise of the current state does not reveal previously sent/received messages.

## Security Considerations

- Delete message keys immediately after decryption
- Implement message ordering and replay protection
- Use authenticated encryption (AES-GCM) for all messages
- Protect identity keys with device-level security
- Verify identity keys out-of-band (safety numbers)

## Validation Criteria

- [ ] X25519 key exchange produces shared secret
- [ ] Messages encrypt and decrypt correctly between two parties
- [ ] Different messages produce different ciphertexts
- [ ] Forward secrecy: old keys cannot decrypt new messages
- [ ] Out-of-order messages can be decrypted
- [ ] Tampered messages are rejected by authentication
