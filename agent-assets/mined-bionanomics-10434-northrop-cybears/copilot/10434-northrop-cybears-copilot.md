## Code Quality Principles

<!-- https://github.com/mieweb/template-mieweb-opensource/blob/main/.github/copilot-instructions.md -->

### 🎯 DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- **Never duplicate code**: If you find yourself copying code, extract it into a reusable function
- **Single source of truth**: Each piece of knowledge should have one authoritative representation
- **Refactor mercilessly**: When you see duplication, eliminate it immediately
- **Shared utilities**: Common patterns should be abstracted into utility functions

### 💋 KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- **Simple solutions**: Prefer the simplest solution that works
- **Avoid over-engineering**: Don't add complexity for hypothetical future needs
- **Clear naming**: Functions and variables should be self-documenting
- **Small functions**: Break down complex functions into smaller, focused ones
- **Readable code**: Code should be obvious to understand at first glance

### 🧹 Folder Philosophy
- **Clear purpose**: Every folder should have a main thing that anchors its contents.
- **No junk drawers**: Don’t leave loose files without context or explanation.
- **Explain relationships**: If it’s not elegantly obvious how files fit together, add a README or note.
- **Immediate clarity**: Opening a folder should make its organizing principle clear at a glance.

### 🔄 Refactoring Guidelines
- **Continuous improvement**: Refactor as you work, not as a separate task
- **Safe refactoring**: Always run tests before and after refactoring
- **Incremental changes**: Make small, safe changes rather than large rewrites
- **Preserve behavior**: Refactoring should not change external behavior
- **Code reviews**: All refactoring should be reviewed for correctness

### ⚰️ Dead Code Management
- **Immediate removal**: Delete unused code immediately when identified
- **Historical preservation**: Move significant dead code to `.attic/` directory with context
- **Documentation**: Include comments explaining why code was moved to attic
- **Regular cleanup**: Review and clean attic directory periodically
- **No accumulation**: Don't let dead code accumulate in active codebase

## Documentation Preferences

### Diagrams and Visual Documentation
- **Always use Mermaid diagrams** instead of ASCII art for workflow diagrams, architecture diagrams, and flowcharts
- **Use memorable names** instead of single letters in diagrams (e.g., `Engine`, `Auth`, `Server` instead of `A`, `B`, `C`)
- Use appropriate Mermaid diagram types:
  - `graph TB` or `graph LR` for workflow architectures 
  - `flowchart TD` for process flows
  - `sequenceDiagram` for API interactions
  - `gitgraph` for branch/release strategies
- Include styling with `classDef` for better visual hierarchy
- Add descriptive comments and emojis sparingly for clarity

### Documentation Standards
- Keep documentation DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) - reference other docs instead of duplicating
- Use clear cross-references between related documentation files
- Update the main architecture document when workflow structure changes

## Working with GitHub Actions Workflows

### Development Philosophy
- **Script-first approach**: All workflows should call scripts that can be run locally
- **Local development parity**: Developers should be able to run the exact same commands locally as CI runs
- **Simple workflows**: GitHub Actions should be thin wrappers around scripts, not contain complex logic
- **Easy debugging**: When CI fails, developers can reproduce the issue locally by running the same script

## Quick Reference

### 🪶 All Changes should be considered for Pull Request Philosophy

* **Smallest viable change**: Always make the smallest change that fully solves the problem.
* **Fewest files first**: Start with the minimal number of files required.
* **No sweeping edits**: Broad refactors or multi-module changes must be split or proposed as new components.
* **Isolated improvements**: If a change grows complex, extract it into a new function, module, or component instead of modifying multiple areas.
* **Direct requests only**: Large refactors or architectural shifts should only occur when explicitly requested.
 
### Code Quality Checklist
- [ ] **DRY**: No code duplication - extracted reusable functions?
- [ ] **KISS**: Simplest solution that works?
- [ ] **Minimal Changes**: Smallest viable change made for PR?
- [ ] **Naming**: Self-documenting function/variable names?
- [ ] **Size**: Functions small and focused?
- [ ] **Dead Code**: Removed or archived appropriately?
- [ ] **Test**: Run tests
