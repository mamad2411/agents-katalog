# Eval-in-Prod Sampling Policy

## Summary

**One-sentence:** Produces a sampling-policy config for production-trace eval: sample rate per route, stratification, judge-call budget, drift detection, alerting.

**Ефективно для:** Production LLM systems with judge-based eval where blanket sampling burns budget on easy cases and starves hard ones; this config makes sampling stratified and budgeted.

**One-paragraph:** This methodology pins the recurring decision around "eval-in-prod sampling policy" into a typed artefact governed by 5 testable rules. Inputs are typed and sourced; the output is contract-checked; a single accountable owner is named; the decision tree routes preconditions to a run/skip outcome. Source material grounded in: Vadim — Workflow-First Production Evals 2026.

## Applies If (ALL must hold)

- Task is an instance of the recurring "eval-in-prod sampling policy" decision OR a closely-adjacent variant.
- Operator has the artefacts named in Prerequisites available before starting.
- Output will be consumed by a downstream agent, gate, or named human reviewer.
- A single accountable owner can be named.
- Tier == geek or higher.

## Skip If (ANY kills it)

- Team already maintains a working artefact for this gap — replace, do not duplicate.
- Single-use throwaway task — overhead of the contract is not justified.
- Regulatory regime mandates a vendor governance platform — defer to vendor flow.
- Greenfield prototype with no production users yet.

## Decision tree

Lives at `content/06-decision-tree.xml`. Two-question tree: (1) preconditions present? - no = skip; yes (2) variant detected per topic-specific signal? - routes to the appropriate produced variant. Terminal branches reference rules in `content/01-core-rules.xml`.
