# Backpressure

**Cite as:** `[Backpressure]`

## Principle
If a producer can outrun a consumer, the system must drop, buffer, or block. Unbounded in-memory queues are bombs — they look fine until traffic spikes and the process runs out of memory.

## Red flags in code
- Unbounded in-memory queue / buffer / timer-driven accumulator with no max size.
- A producer with no flow-control mechanism.
- A consumer that processes asynchronously without a bounded work queue.

## Apply directly (mechanical, unambiguous)
- Add a `maxSize` / capacity to an unbounded queue when the policy is clear (drop, block, or reject).

## Propose only (requires judgment)
- Choosing the right backpressure policy (drop oldest, reject newest, block producer).
