# Trade-off explicitness

**Cite as:** `[Trade-off explicitness]`

## Principle
No "best" architecture, only the least-worst trade-off. Every architecture decision sacrifices something. The deliverable of an architectural choice is the explicit trade-off statement, not a victory.

## Red flags in code / decisions
- Architecture choice presented as "the right one" with no stated trade-off.
- ADR / design doc that lists benefits but no sacrifices.
- A commit introducing a major architectural shift with no rationale.

## Apply directly (mechanical, unambiguous)
- None — this is a process / documentation concern.

## Propose only (requires judgment)
- Suggesting the missing trade-off statement for a decision.
