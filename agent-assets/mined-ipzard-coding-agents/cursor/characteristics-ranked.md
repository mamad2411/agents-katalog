# Characteristics ranked

**Cite as:** `[Characteristics ranked]`

## Principle
The "-ilities" (scalability, elasticity, availability, fault tolerance, deployability, testability, maintainability, performance, security) must be ranked, not maximized. Prioritize a small set for this system and accept mediocre on the rest.

## Red flags in code / decisions
- A design claiming to optimize "everything."
- Investment in characteristics that the system doesn't actually need (high availability for an internal-only batch tool, etc.).

## Apply directly (mechanical, unambiguous)
- None — this is a prioritization concern.

## Propose only (requires judgment)
- Identifying the top characteristics for this system.
