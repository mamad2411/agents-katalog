# Scalability vs elasticity

**Cite as:** `[Scalability vs elasticity]`

## Principle
Scalability is responsiveness under gradual load growth. Elasticity is responsiveness during sudden spikes. Different problems, different solutions.

## Red flags in code / decisions
- Autoscaling configured aggressively for an app with steady, predictable load (premature elasticity — operational cost without benefit).
- A system claiming "scalable" without distinguishing whether it handles gradual growth or sudden spikes.

## Apply directly (mechanical, unambiguous)
- None.

## Propose only (requires judgment)
- Choosing scalability vs elasticity for a new workload.
- Right-sizing autoscaling for the actual traffic pattern.
